                      <p>In April of 1959 I was born in Idaho Falls Idaho and grew up on a dairy farm. I milked cows and hauled hay for my father during my teenage years until I left home to serve an LDS mission in Pennsylvania.  Upon coming home, I moved to California to work in the computer industry.</p>
                      <p>After a year of that I Moved to Provo Utah where I met Loraine Saunders and she cheerfully agreed to marry me.  Loraine and I have been married for 33 years, of which 30 of those years we have lived in Alpine.  We have raised our 6 children here, they are all married and we have 10 grandchildren with number 11 soon to come.</p>
                      <p>I ‘ve been a small business owner for 25 years, in both Salt Lake and Utah Counties.</p>
                      <p>I love to serve people.</p>
                      <p>I have served in bishoprics for 11 ½ years; 5 of which I was a bishop.</p>
                      <p>I have worked with different youth groups and served for many years with the Boy Scouts of America, 6 years as a scoutmaster.</p>
                      <p>I served on a business advisory committee at Salt Lake Community College.</p>
                      <p>I have served several times as both a county and state precinct delegate.</p>
                      <p>In March 2014 I was appointed to fill the seat of Councilman Mel Clement.</p>
                      <p>Prior to being appointed I was asked if I would read and study the information packets and attend all council meetings. I have done this with all diligence. Currently serving on the city Council has definitely been challenging yet because I love all my neighbors it pleases me to serve and work through the difficulties.</p>
                      <p>Now we are here tonight, that’s it 56 years in two minutes. Thanks for coming tonight and thanks for your caring support in the past, tonight, and in the days to come.</p>

                        <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center
                            because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

                        <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

                        <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

                        <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish
                            her.</p>

                        <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those
                            which divide us.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

                        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                        <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you
                            touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
