                <p>
                    My wife Loraine and I have lived in Alpine for 30 years, raising six children. For the past 25 years I have owned and operated a sprinkler &amp; landscape company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In March 2014 I was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Alpine City Council. Since that time I have spent many hours studying documents and attending all necessary meetings. I make an exerted effort to gain the perspective of others before voting on an issue. I do this to gain a well-rounded view of the concerns being discussed. Currently there are land use and annexation issues that are creating a lot of emotional fervor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My desire is to encourage unity and civility, respect for personal property rights, and provide balanced information. My goal is to help develop a sense of community as decisions are made about residential and business- commercial zones. I feel these concerns need to be resolved with logic and common sense. I have no personal agenda. This is important since there are many concerns that need a sincere and fair approach in the decision making process. I love to serve and help my community in any way I can.
